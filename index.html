Liquidity Fragmentation is broken across chains 

Bridge risk causes uncertainty with wrapping and unwrapping 

Suwappu is a new dapp chain that will be focusing on simply aggreating, swapping, lending, building the largest stablecoin pools. 

Building on top of the progress of defi primitives like UNI COMP AAVE and CURVE we a working on something new

Automatic market-makers (AMMs) are one of the major innovations which decentralized finance brought. First, Uniswap brought markets created by x·y = k
invariant which doesn’t make any assumption about pricing of underlying assets and spreads liquidity across all prices evenly. Next, we introduced the
stableswap invariant which allowed to focus most of liquidity around price 1.0
(or really any price), a very useful feature for creating stablecoin-to-stablecoin
liquidity.

Suwappu provides a mechanism to create cross-markets for stablecoins in a way which could be called “Uniswap with leverage”. It is a fully
autonomous market-maker for stablecoins with very minimal price slippage, as well as an efficient “fiat savings account” for liquidity providers
on the other side.
